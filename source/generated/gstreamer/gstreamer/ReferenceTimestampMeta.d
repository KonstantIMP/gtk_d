 * captured.

 * The reference is stored as a #GstCaps in @reference. Examples of valid
 * references would be "timestamp/x-drivername-stream" for timestamps that are locally
 * generated by some driver named "drivername" when generating the stream,
 * e.g. based on a frame counter, or "timestamp/x-ntp, host=pool.ntp.org,
 * port=123" for timestamps based on a specific NTP server.
