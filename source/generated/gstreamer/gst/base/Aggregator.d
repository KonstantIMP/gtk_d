/**
 * Manages a set of pads with the purpose of aggregating their buffers.
 * Control is given to the subclass when all pads have data.
 * 
 * * Base class for mixers and muxers. Subclasses should at least implement
 * the #GstAggregatorClass.aggregate() virtual method.
 * 
 * * Installs a #GstPadChainFunction, a #GstPadEventFullFunction and a
 * #GstPadQueryFunction to queue all serialized data packets per sink pad.
 * Subclasses should not overwrite those, but instead implement
 * #GstAggregatorClass.sink_event() and #GstAggregatorClass.sink_query() as
 * needed.
 * 
 * * When data is queued on all pads, the aggregate vmethod is called.
 * 
 * * One can peek at the data on any given GstAggregatorPad with the
 * gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() method, and remove it from the pad
 * with the gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer () method. When a buffer
 * has been taken with pop_buffer (), a new buffer can be queued
 * on that pad.
 * 
 * * When gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer()
 * are called, a reference is taken to the returned buffer, which stays
 * valid until either:
 * 
 * - gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
 * is guaranteed that the buffer they receive is the same as the peeked
 * buffer.
 * - gst_aggregator_pad_drop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
 * is guaranteed that the dropped buffer is the one that was peeked.
 * - the subclass implementation of #GstAggregatorClass.aggregate returns.
 * 
 * Subsequent calls to gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or
 * gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer() return / check the same buffer that was
 * returned / checked, until one of the conditions listed above is met.
 * 
 * Subclasses are only allowed to call these methods from the aggregate
 * thread.
 * 
 * * If the subclass wishes to push a buffer downstream in its aggregate
 * implementation, it should do so through the
 * gst_aggregator_finish_buffer() method. This method will take care
 * of sending and ordering mandatory events such as stream start, caps
 * and segment. Buffer lists can also be pushed out with
 * gst_aggregator_finish_buffer_list().
 * 
 * * Same goes for EOS events, which should not be pushed directly by the
 * subclass, it should instead return GST_FLOW_EOS in its aggregate
 * implementation.
 * 
 * * Note that the aggregator logic regarding gap event handling is to turn
 * these into gap buffers with matching PTS and duration. It will also
 * flag these buffers with GST_BUFFER_FLAG_GAP and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DROPPABLE
 * to ease their identification and subsequent processing.
 * 
 * * Subclasses must use (a subclass of) #GstAggregatorPad for both their
 * sink and source pads.
 * See gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template_with_gtype().
 * 
 * This class used to live in gst-plugins-bad and was moved to core.
 *
 * Since: 1.14
