    /**
    * Like soup_socket_read(), but reads no further than the first
    * occurrence of @boundary. (If the boundary is found, it will be
    * included in the returned data, and *@got_boundary will be set to
    * %TRUE.) Any data after the boundary will returned in future reads.
    *
    * soup_socket_read_until() will almost always return fewer than @len
    * bytes: if the boundary is found, then it will only return the bytes
    * up until the end of the boundary, and if the boundary is not found,
    * then it will leave the last <literal>(boundary_len - 1)</literal>
    * bytes in its internal buffer, in case they form the start of the
    * boundary string. Thus, @len normally needs to be at least 1 byte
    * longer than @boundary_len if you want to make any progress at all.
    *
    * Params:
    *     buffer = buffer to read
    *         into
    *     boundary = boundary to read until
    *     boundaryLen = length of @boundary in bytes
    *     nread = on return, the number of bytes read into @buffer
    *     gotBoundary = on return, whether or not the data in @buffer
    *         ends with the boundary string
    *     cancellable = a #GCancellable, or %NULL
    *
    * Returns: as for soup_socket_read()
    *
    * Throws: GException on failure.
